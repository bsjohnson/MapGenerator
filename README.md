# Dungeosis
A maze generator for C#.  The primary algorithm for generating this maze was adapted from this fantastic tutorial by Bob Nystrom, which can be found [here](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/12/21/rooms-and-mazes/).

## Why C#?
A couple reasons:
1. A chance to play with C# as I rarely get the chance to work with it. Different languages and different platforms can tickle different parts of the brain.
2. [Unity](https://unity.com/) integration. I wanted something I could adapt and plug in to the tutorials to visualize the generated map.  Taking the resulting map array and converting to a performant 3D model is an interesting challenge.
